## About me
- I am an incoming Master's student who is interested in Programming Languages and Mathematics.
- I am still very new to research, and I hope to eventually contribute to the academic community in developing the frontier.
- Here is a list of topics I wish to become better at:
	- Programming Languages:
		- Type Theory (Dependent Types, HoTT, Meta Programming)
		- Theorem Provers (Coq, Agda, Pie)
		- Algebraic Effects
	- Mathematics:
		- Logic
		- Topology
		- Category Theory
